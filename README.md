# Document Cleaning Pipeline üßπüìù

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for cleaning scanned document images. The pipeline leverages a **DnCNN-based convolutional neural network** for denoising, coupled with adaptive thresholding and post-processing, to generate clean, readable outputs that are ideal for both **human readability** and **text mining**.

## **Features** ‚ú®

- **Denoising with DnCNN**:
  Uses a pre-trained DnCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) to remove noise while preserving important text details.
  
- **Adaptive Thresholding**:
  Sharpens text, enhances contrast, and creates uniform backgrounds for better readability and machine processing.

- **PDF Conversion**:
  Converts cleaned images into grayscale, high-resolution PDFs for archival and text mining.

- **Batch Processing**:
  Processes all images in a folder and generates cleaned images and PDFs in bulk.
